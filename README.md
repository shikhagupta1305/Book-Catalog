## Library Management System - Documentation

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the Library Management System, including the HTML (`library.html`), CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.

**File Breakdown:**

**1. `library.html`**

* **Structure:**
    * **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** Declares the document as HTML5.
    * **`<html lang="en">`:** Defines the document as HTML and specifies English as the language.
    * **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information about the document.
        * **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`:** Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper display of all characters.
        * **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`:** Configures the viewport for responsiveness on different devices.
        * **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`:** Links the external CSS stylesheet (`styles.css`).
        * **`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`:** Imports the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts.
        * **`<title>Library Management System</title>`:** Sets the title of the HTML document, displayed in the browser tab.
    * **`<body>`:** Contains the visible content of the webpage.
        * **`<header>`:**  The header section of the page.
            * **`<nav>`:** Provides navigation links.
                * **`<ul>`:** Unordered list containing navigation links.
                * **`<li>`:** List items for each navigation link.
                * **`<a>`:** Anchor tags for the links.
        * **`<main>`:** Contains the main content of the webpage.
            * **`<section id="search">`:**  A section for searching books.
                * **`<h2>`:** Heading for the search section.
                * **`<input type="text" id="searchBar" ...>`:** Text input field for search queries.
                * **`<button id="searchButton">`:** Button to trigger search.
                * **`<div id="loadingIndicator" ...>`:** A loading indicator to display while searching.
            * **`<section id="books">`:** A section to display available books.
                * **`<div id="bookDisplay" ...>`:** Container where the book details will be displayed.
        * **`<script src="script.js"></script>`:**  Includes the JavaScript file (`script.js`) to handle webpage interactions and logic.

**2. `styles.css`**

* **Styling:**  This file contains CSS rules for styling the elements in the `library.html` page. 
* **Layout:** The styles define the layout of the page, including the header, main content, sections, and navigation.
* **Visual Appearance:** The styles control the visual appearance of elements like fonts, colors, borders, padding, margins, and background images.
* **Responsiveness:** The styles may include media queries to ensure the page adapts properly to different screen sizes. 

**3. `script.js`**

* **Functionality:** This file contains JavaScript code that defines the behavior and interactivity of the Library Management System.
* **Search Functionality:** The JavaScript handles the search functionality, including:
    * Event listener for the search button.
    * Retrieving search query from the input field.
    * Displaying the loading indicator.
    * Making an API call to search for books based on the query.
    * Displaying the search results in the `bookDisplay` section.
    * Hiding the loading indicator. 
* **Book Display:** The JavaScript handles displaying the book information.
    * Dynamically generating HTML elements to represent each book found.
    * Adding book details (title, author, genre, etc.) to the elements. 

**How to Use:**

1. **Create the necessary files:**  Create `library.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files in the same directory.
2. **HTML Structure:**  Ensure the HTML structure in `library.html` is correctly implemented.
3. **CSS Styling:**  Add styling to `styles.css` to achieve the desired look and feel.
4. **JavaScript Logic:** Implement the necessary logic in `script.js` to handle search functionality, book display, and any other desired features.
5. **Data Source:**  You will need a data source for the book information. This could be a local JSON file, a database, or an external API.
6. **API Integration:**  If you are using an external API, integrate it into the JavaScript code.

**Additional Notes:**

* The specific implementation of the search functionality, book display, and API integration will depend on the chosen data source and the desired features of the library management system.
* Remember to consider best practices for web development, including clean code, accessibility, and responsiveness.
